SMTP
====

When the SMTP option is selected from the protocol menu, users will be asked if they want to
login to their own gmail account to model the protocol, or use one embedded within the system. 
Then to step through the commands of the protocol users simply press 'Execute Next Command' 
and all handshaking is displayed in the log box. For full documentation on how to use this section
of the system view the 'README.pdf' located in the same directory as the program code. 

Protocol Commands:

HELO - Opens a dialogue with the server 
MAIL FROM - The email address to send the email from
RCPT TO - An array of recipients for the email
DATA - The body (content) of the email
QUIT - Closes the connection with the mail server
