IMAP
====

When the IMAP option is selected from the protocol menu, users will be asked if they want to
login to their own gmail account to model the protocol, or use one embedded within the system. 
Then to step through the commands of the protocol users simply press 'Execute Next Command' 
and all handshaking is displayed in the log box. For full documentation on how to use this section
of the system view the 'README.pdf' located in the same directory as the program code. 

Protocol commands:

LOGIN - Logs a user into gmails email server by sending email address and password
EXAMINE - Changes to the remote folder you wish to examine (Inbox)
LIST - Outputs the contents of the remote folder (lists emails)
FETCH - Gets the content of selected email
LOGOUT - Closes the connection
