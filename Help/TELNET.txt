TELNET
======

The TELNET protocol, when selected from the main menu, will log you into a remote windows 
server using TELNET. From here you can execute a number of commands on the server to see how
TELNET sends commands to and from a server in order to allow users to gain an understanding of 
protocol handshaking. For a full guide on how to use this section of the system, see the 
'README.pdf' located in the same directory as the program code. 

Commands that can be executed (dos):

netstat - shows the network connections the machine has. 
tree - outputs the directory structure
exit - terminates running command prompts 
mkdir - create a directory 
dir - output directory listing 
ver - shows the dos version
tasklist - shows running processes 
ipconfig - displays current TCP/IP network configuration values
