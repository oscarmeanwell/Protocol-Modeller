FTP
===

When you select FTP from the modelling protocols menu the system will automatically log you into
an FTP server that you can modify the content of. You can execute a series of commands on the 
server, these are listed in the left hand box. To get an overview of how to use the FTP section of 
the system, go to the README.pdf in the same direcotry as the source code.

The commands:

rmdir - delete a directory 
cd - change a directory 
close/bye - close ftp session
delete - remove a file
get - download a file
ls - output directory listing 
mkdir - create a directory 
put - upload a file
pwd - lists current remote directory
