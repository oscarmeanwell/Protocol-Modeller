Welcome to the load previous help section! 
==========================================

The Load Previous section enables you as a user to load a previous session to enable them to 
revise. This is a feature that is present so that if you need to leave your revision you will be able 
to continue where you left off at a later date. For full documentation on how to use this section of 
the system view the 'README.pdf' located in the same directory as the program code.
